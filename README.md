# Moodle Block Notify

The concept behind this block is that it will show actions that need to be
taken by certain users. For example, should a subset of users need to take a
survey, you upload a CSV full of the users who need to take the survey, the
message (customized, if you like) to each user, start/end date/time, and 
the course where the message should appear, the info will appear in this block.
